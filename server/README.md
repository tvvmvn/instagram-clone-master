## Quick Start

To get this project up and running locally on your computer:

1. Set up a [Node.js](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/development_environment) development environment.
2. Once you have node setup, enter the following commands in the root of your clone of this repo:

   ```bash
   npm install
   DEBUG=instagram-clone-master:* npm run devstart   #For linux
   ```

3. Open a browser to <http://localhost:3000/> to open the library site.

> **Note:** The library uses a default MongoDB database hosted on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). You should use a different database for your own code experiments.
